# NaviQ - Orkes Conductor Integration

## Overview

This directory contains the integration of Orkes Conductor workflow orchestration engine with the NaviQ navigation platform.

## What is Orkes Conductor?

Orkes Conductor is a microservices orchestration engine that helps manage complex workflows in distributed systems. It provides:

- Workflow-as-Code definitions
- Resilient task execution
- Built-in monitoring and observability
- Scalable architecture
- Rich task types (HTTP, Lambda, SubWorkflow, etc.)

## Integration Benefits for NaviQ

### 1. **Navigation Workflow Orchestration**

- **Multi-step Pathfinding**: Coordinate complex navigation queries that involve multiple buildings, floors, and route optimizations
- **Conditional Routing**: Handle different navigation scenarios based on user type, accessibility needs, or real-time conditions
- **Error Recovery**: Automatically retry failed pathfinding operations with fallback mechanisms

### 2. **AI Bot Processing Pipeline**

- **Query Classification**: Orchestrate the flow from user query → type detection → response generation
- **Context Management**: Maintain conversation state across multiple bot interactions
- **Response Validation**: Ensure bot responses meet quality standards before delivery

### 3. **Map Data Management Workflows**

- **Building Creation Pipeline**: Coordinate building → floors → nodes → edges creation process
- **Data Validation**: Ensure map data integrity through multi-step validation workflows
- **Bulk Operations**: Handle large-scale map updates through orchestrated batch processes
     
### 4. **Payment & Subscription Orchestration**

- **Payment Processing**: Coordinate payment verification, subscription activation, and user notification
- **Subscription Management**: Handle subscription renewals, upgrades, and cancellations
- **Billing Workflows**: Automate invoice generation and payment reminders

### 5. **User Journey Orchestration**

- **Onboarding Flow**: Coordinate user registration, verification, and initial setup
- **Admin Workflows**: Handle organization setup, map creation, and user management
- **Notification Systems**: Orchestrate multi-channel notifications (email, push, SMS)

## Workflow Examples

### 1. **Smart Navigation Workflow**

```javascript
// When user asks: "How do I get from Library to Cafeteria?"
NavigationWorkflow {
  tasks: [
    1. ValidateUserQuery
    2. ClassifyQueryType (P for Pathfinding)
    3. ExtractLocations (source: Library, destination: Cafeteria)
    4. FindOptimalPath (using Dijkstra algorithm)
    5. GenerateDirections
    6. SendResponse
  ]
}
```

### 2. **Map Creation Workflow**

```javascript
// When admin creates a new building with multiple floors
BuildingCreationWorkflow {
  tasks: [
    1. ValidateAdminPermissions
    2. CreateBuilding
    3. ProcessFloorData (parallel for each floor)
    4. CreateNodes (for each floor)
    5. CreateConnections (edges between nodes)
    6. ValidateMapIntegrity
    7. PublishMapData
    8. NotifyUsers
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Payment Processing Workflow**

```javascript
// When user upgrades subscription
PaymentWorkflow {
  tasks: [
    1. ValidatePaymentData
    2. ProcessPayment (Cashfree integration)
    3. UpdateSubscription
    4. SendConfirmationEmail
    5. ActivateFeatures
    6. LogTransaction
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Setup Conductor Server** (see `docker-compose.yml`)
2. **Install Dependencies** (see `package.json`)
3. **Configure Workflows** (see `workflows/` directory)
4. **Create Task Workers** (see `workers/` directory)
5. **Integrate with Backend** (see `integration/` directory)

## Key Features Implementation

### Real-time Updates

- Use Conductor's event-driven architecture for real-time map updates
- Coordinate live navigation assistance with multiple users

### Scalability

- Handle high-traffic scenarios during peak navigation times
- Distribute workload across multiple worker instances

### Monitoring & Analytics

- Built-in workflow monitoring dashboard
- Track user navigation patterns and optimize routes
- Monitor system performance and bottlenecks

### Error Handling

- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging and alerting

## Integration with Existing Code

Your current backend already has the Conductor JavaScript SDK installed:

```json
"@io-orkes/conductor-javascript": "^2.1.4"
```

This integration will enhance your existing:

- ✅ Bot Controllers (`BotControllers/`)
- ✅ Map Controllers (`mapControllers/`)
- ✅ Payment Controllers
- ✅ Authentication System

## Benefits for Hackathon

2. **Scalability Story**: Shows how the system can handle complex, real-world scenarios
3. **Sponsor Integration**: Directly showcases Orkes technology in a practical application
4. **Differentiation**: Sets your project apart with advanced orchestration capabilities
5. **Demo-Ready**: Visual workflow monitoring provides excellent demo material

## Next Steps

1. Review the setup files in this directory
2. Run the Docker Compose setup to start Conductor
3. Implement your first workflow (navigation is recommended)
4. Integrate with your existing Express.js backend
5. Test end-to-end workflow execution
6. Add monitoring and observability
