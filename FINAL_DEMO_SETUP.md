## 🎬 **Demo Flow for Judges (10 minutes)**

### **Opening (1 minute)**
> "We've built NaviQ with Netflix-grade workflow orchestration. This isn't just a navigation app - it's enterprise architecture that showcases how Orkes Conductor can transform any application."

### **Demo Point 1: Smart Navigation (4 minutes)**
1. **Show Orkes Dashboard First**
   - "This is our enterprise control center"
   - "Same technology Netflix uses for their entire platform"

2. **Send Navigation Request**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/conductor/navigation/sync \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"userQuery": "How do I get from CS Building to Library?", "userId": "judge_demo", "adminId": "demo_admin"}'
   ```

3. **Point to Real-time Execution**
   - "Watch each step execute in real-time"
   - "Query validation → Location extraction → Path calculation"
   - "Automatic monitoring, retries, error handling"

### **Demo Point 2: Scalability (3 minutes)**
1. **Multiple Parallel Requests**
   ```bash
   # Run this command 5 times quickly
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/conductor/navigation \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"userQuery": "Navigate to Building X", "userId": "user1", "adminId": "demo_admin"}' &
   ```

2. **Show Dashboard**
   - "All workflows running simultaneously"
   - "No blocking, professional scalability"
   - "This handles thousands of students"

### **Demo Point 3: Complex Workflows (2 minutes)**
1. **Building Creation**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/conductor/building/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"adminId": "demo_admin", "buildingData": {"name": "Innovation Hub"}, "floorsData": [{"floorNumber": 1}, {"floorNumber": 2}]}'
   ```

2. **Show Parallel Processing**
   - "Multiple floors processed simultaneously"
   - "Enterprise data validation"
   - "Automatic rollback on errors"
